# Learning the react

## Started Day 1

- Started by creating files for a React app using two different methods:
    - **Using Create React App:**
        - `npx create-react-app my-app`
        - `npm run start`
    - **Using Vite + React:**
        - `npm create vite@latest`
        - `npm run dev`
        - `npm install` (to install the required `node_modules`)
        - This method is comparatively faster than Create React App.
- Deleted unnecessary files and explored the flow of various functions to understand how they work within the app.

## Day 2 
- Today, I learned about hooks in React, focusing on how they work and why they are important.
- Hooks are used for updating the UI; for example, `useState` helps manage the counter value wherever it is displayed.
- I created a 02_counter project where I used `useState` to update the counter variable. It changes as I increment or decrement the count.
- I added a condition to keep the counter within a range of 0 to 20, ensuring it doesn’t go negative or exceed the maximum limit.

That’s what I worked on today!

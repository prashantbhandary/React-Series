# Learning the react

## Started Day 1

- Starting with the creating files for the react app by two different method:
    - By creating the react app:
        - npx create-react-app my-app 
        - npm run start
    - By using the vite+react:
        - npm create vite@latest
        - npm run dev
        - npm install (to install thee the required node_modules )
        - this method is comparatively faster than the creating the react app.
- I deleted today all the unecessay files and figues out the flow of different funtion how it works out there.
